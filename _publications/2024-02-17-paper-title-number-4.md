Green credit policy is popular for government to encourage firms to engage in environmental protection. In order to analyze the government’s and firm’s strategies in implementing the green credit policy, we construct both one-shot Bayesian persuasion model and two-stage Bayesian persuasion model with opt- out option in this paper. We analyze the equilibria under different parameters and compare two models for policy implications.
