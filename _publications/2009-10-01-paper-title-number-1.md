We examine a tug-of-war game between two players, employing the Tullock contest success function within the framework of dynamic resource allocation. Our aim is to establish a Markov perfect equilibrium of this game (if it exists) using pure strategies, and we show that there exist closed-form solutions for both playersâ€™strategies and winning probabilities. In each state, the optimal strategy for both players is to allocate the same proportion of their current endowment as their opponent, thereby maintaining a constant ratio of their endowments throughout the game. Furthermore, we discuss some extensions with a minimum score requirement and asymmetric score goal, respectively. In addition, We offer novel insights into the performance of the players in a dynamic contest under resource allocation framework, in contrast to that under cost structure framework.
