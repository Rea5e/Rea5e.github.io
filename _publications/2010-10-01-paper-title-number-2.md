In this paper, we present the incorporation of two significant factors, namely the social preference factor and the sequential move factor, into the classical lottery contest. Our objective is to address the equilibrium of the contest and examine the impact of social preference on playersâ€™ strategies. Through our analysis, we establish that higher social preference results in lower effort. Additionally, we extend our model to describe situation with heterogeneous social preference parameters, and we demonstrate that the solution can be derived in a similar method.
