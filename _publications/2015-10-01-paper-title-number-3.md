Labor market is an important scenario in the real world, and waiting-list is frequently used as employersâ€™ strategy. Based on this thinking, we extend the Deferred Acceptance to Deferred Acceptance with Waiting-list and show this mechanism is well-defined, stable but not strategy-proof nor efficient. By introducing cycle-breaking phase, this mechanism improves the weak position of employees in the labor market, and increases the welfare of them.
